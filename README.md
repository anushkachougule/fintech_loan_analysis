# Exploring Lending Practices and Customer Insights in Fintech

## Overview  
This project analyzes lending practices and customer behavior in the Fintech industry using a data-driven approach. By leveraging AWS-based data pipelines and interactive Tableau dashboards, we identify key patterns in loan issuance, repayment, and regional lending trends.  

## Objectives  
- Optimize loan approval processes and identify patterns in lending.  
- Segment customers based on demographics and behavior.  
- Analyze regional trends in borrowing and loan distribution.  
- Develop interactive visualizations for strategic insights.  

## Dataset  
The project uses the **BigQuery Fintech Dataset** from Kaggle, which includes customer demographics, loan details, lending trends, and regional borrowing data.
